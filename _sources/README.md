# Ross 2022 Machine Learning Parameterizations Demo
Collection of tutorialized notebooks on Ross 2022 machine learning subgrid parametrizations 

## Structure and Organization of the Repo
This project uses [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) to organize a collection of Jupyter Notebooks into a website. 

- The notebooks all live in the [notebooks](https://github.com/ocean-transport/ross22_demo/tree/main/notebooks) directory. Note that the outputs of execution within the notebooks are saved and are thus not executed as part of the build process.
- The table of contents is located in [\_toc.yml](https://github.com/ocean-transport/ross22_demo/blob/main/_toc.yml).
- The book configuration is in [\_config.yml](https://github.com/ocean-transport/ross22_demo/blob/main/_config.yml).
